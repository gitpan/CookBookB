CookBookB - Dean's Extension-Building Cookbook, part B.

These are the same examples you've seen posted to comp.lang.perl.misc in
late '95 and early '96.  All of them are about letting Perl manipulate C
structures or C++ objects.

Struct1: A very simple example showing how Perl can create, manipulate, and
	destroy a C structure.

Opaque: Another simple example of letting Perl create, manipulate, and
	destroy a C structure.  I think I named it Opaque because I was
	trying to emphasize that the simplest way to do this is to allow the
	C object to be opaque to Perl.

ListOfStruct: An example of letting Perl manipulate a linked list of C
	structures.

ArrayOfStruct: An example of letting Perl manipulate an array of C
	structures.

CCsimple: A very simple example showing how Perl can create, manipulate,
	and destroy a C++ object.

Struct2: This is the Struct1 example using typemaps which convert the C
	structure to and from a Perl array.  This is "the hard way"; Struct1
	and Opaque are "the easy way".

Struct3: This is the Struct1 example using typemaps which convert the C
	structure to and from a Perl hash.  This is "the hard way"; Struct1
	and Opaque are "the easy way".

Mstruct: This shows C-like interfaces to some C functions which take
	pointers to C structs.  I do not recommend using this non-Perl style.

Most examples contain NOTES files which describe how they were created.

Some of these examples rely on my perlobject.map typemap, which is included
in the package and can also be found on CPAN in the same place you found
this package.

If you are going to do datatype conversions between C and Perl, which is
what XS programming is all about, then you would be doing yourself a favor
to install Devel::Peek and to learn how to use its Dump() function.  The
DevelPeek.pod document in this package is a preliminary manpage/tutorial.

For other examples of extension-building, covering a wider range of
mini-topics, consult the CookBookA package, which is part A of this
Extension-Building CookBook series.  CookBookA can be found on CPAN in the
same place you found this CookBookB package.
